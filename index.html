			<h1>Welcome to my site. <br>Please come in and stay awhile.</h1>
			<p>I started this website because Halloween has always been my favorite holiday. But during the last year, I started selling some of my favorite 
				Halloween products, and they've become quite a hit. <br> <br> If you click on the Personal link, you can browse my favorite Halloween pictures, 
				stories, and films. And if you join my email list, I will keep you up-to-date on all things Halloween.</p>

			<h3>My guarantee</h3>
			<p>If you aren't completely satisfied with everything you buy from my site, you can return it for a full refund. <strong> No questions asked! </strong>
